## 🎯 Purpose & Intended Users

### Purpose

To visually demonstrate how a homeowner might interact with a unified platform in order to monitor, forecast, and control home energy systems.

### Intended Users

- Homeowners with solar & storage  
- Energy management system providers  
- Designers & developers  
- Instructors evaluating design, workflow, and usability  

### Example Use Case

A user wants to:

- Track solar power generation in real time  
- Check current battery charge levels  
- Schedule EV charging at an optimal time  
- Receive automatic recommendations for saving energy

## 🧱 Scope of This Prototype

This repository contains **design only (UI/UX prototype)**.  
It does **not** include backend logic, real device integration, or functional energy simulation code.

The goals of this prototype are to:

- Demonstrate layout and information hierarchy  
- Illustrate the end-to-end user workflow  
- Prepare for future conversion into a working application  
- Allow stakeholders to evaluate usability and design decisions

## 🧭 Alignment With Product Development Plan

This prototype matches the originally defined product concept:

- ✅ Clear target user: **home energy consumers**  
- ✅ Clear use case: **visualizing and optimizing home energy flows**  
- ✅ Minimal user inputs required (most information is visualized and pre-configured)  
- ✅ Intuitive navigation suitable even for non-technical users  
- ✅ Design guided by stakeholder expectations and energy-tech UX best practices

## 📌 Notes for Future Implementation

If this UI is extended into a working tool, possible directions include:

- Implementing the interface in React / Vue / Flutter or Streamlit  
- Connecting to real-time data from home energy devices or APIs  
- Adding machine learning models for forecasting and optimization  
- Integrating authentication and personalized user profiles  

For now, this repository is focused on the **design prototype** and related documentation.
